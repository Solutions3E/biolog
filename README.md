Real-Time Health Intelligence

Biolog.io is a free and open source personal health record (PHR).
Biolog.io is in development.
It seeks to combine
* Personal Health Record - a log of your personal health information
* Expert System - checks your information against known rules, flags some issues it identifies
* Quantified Self - self tracking of metrics
* Quality Improvement - produce checklists, capture feedback, reduce errors

Biolog.io is built using Meteor (meteor.com).
Meteor allows Biolog to be built from a single code base.
This significantly reduces the work of development and maintenance.
